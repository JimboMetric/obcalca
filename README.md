# ObCalca

ObCalca is an Obsidian plugin that performs inline calculations using `math.js`.
Define variables or functions in any markdown document or the global `variables.md` file.
Use `=>` after an assignment or variable name to evaluate it.

Example:
```
x = 10 => 10
y = x + 5 => 15
z => 15
```

Type `@?` to display currently defined variables.
